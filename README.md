Python Codes for understanding Classes, Objects, Modules, and PIP.
## Class
A class is the user-defined blueprint of objects. It provides a means of bundling data & functionality together. The syntax for class definition:

class Class_Name:<br/>
  //body_statement

The class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and functions together. Some key points related to Python class:
  - Classes are created by the keyword "class".
  - Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
  - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.
    E.g., class.My_attribute

## Object
An object is an instance of a class i.e., a copy of the class with actual values. An object consists of:
  - State => represented by the object attributes and reflects the properties of the object.
  - Behavior => represented by the object methods and reflects the response of an object to other objects.
  - Identity => gives the object a unique name and enables the object to interact with another object.

The syntax for object:

obj = ClassName() <br/>
print(obj.attr)
